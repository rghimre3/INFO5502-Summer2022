        "Part A: Given Inetd dataset, an intrusion detection dataset that contains 2 columns. The first column represents a process ID number (PID) and the second column represents a system call. The goal is to extract the entire system call sequence by its PID, then tokenize and parse each sequence into 25-grams. After this, we’ll split the data into training and testing sets. Next, we ensure data quality in the training dataset by removing duplicate sequences within each class and overlapped sequences between both classes. To ensure a fair evaluation, we also clean the testing set by repeating the previous step. You will implement a Decision Tree model to train and test on the training set and testing set that we just clean. \n",

The impact of customers’ reviews on customer’s decision making is significant. Therefore, businesses try to increase this impact by increasing the ratio of the positive reviews to negative reviews. One effective way to increase the ratio is offering the incentives such as small gifts or free next services to customers to post the reviews for item they purchase or used.
